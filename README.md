# AbuseScanner
AbuseScanner is a simple API client, written in Python, that scans malicious URLs or file hashes through querying Abuse.ch databases.

The client calls the URLhaus, ThreatFox, and/or Malware Bazaar APIs to look up inputted URLs or file hashes in their respective databases. Published URLs, IOCs, or file hashes are known to be malicious. 

To run the client run the _abusescanner.py_ script.
